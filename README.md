# project 1: Logistic Regression
you will be implementing logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, you will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically you will:

Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text
## Implement logistic regression from scratch
Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
Test using your logistic regression
Perform error analysis

# project 2: Autocorrect
You use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer. you will explore what really goes on behind the scenes.

prosedure step by step:

- Get a word count given a corpus
- Get a word probability in the corpus
- Manipulate strings
- Filter strings
- Implement Minimum edit distance to compare strings and to help find the optimal path for the edits.
- Understand how dynamic programming works
Similar systems are used everywhere.

For example, if you type in the word "I am lerningg", chances are very high that you meant to write "learning", as shown in Figure 1.

# project 3: Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)

Parts-of-Speech Tagging (POS)

Distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence will help you better understand the meaning of a sentence. This would be critically important in search queries. Identifying the proper noun, the organization, the stock symbol, or anything similar would greatly improve everything ranging from speech recognition to search. By completing this assignment, you will:

- Learn how parts-of-speech tagging works
- Compute the transition matrix A in a Hidden Markov Model
- Compute the emission matrix B in a Hidden Markov Model
- Compute the Viterbi algorithm
- Compute the accuracy of your own model
